# Hypothesis-Testing
Hypothesis Testing Solution in Python to implement and plot Z-Test/T-test based on user inputs.

Using_hyp_testing.pynb uses hyp_testing.py to implement the solution.

Based on the user inputs in Using_hyp_testing.pynb the hyp_testing module automatically decides whether it should do the  Z-Test/T-test, it does both one tail and two tail tests. This solution is designed keeping alpha = 0.05.
